## 2026-04-05 to 2026-04-06 | Dashboard sync + mobile UX + task batch | YL/OPS

### Requested
- Sync local Projects folder with GitHub (GitHub as source of truth)
- Fix git pull issues (index.lock, local changes blocking merge)
- Fix dashboard mobile responsiveness
- Set up Gist token sync for cross-device (iPhone + desktop) XP/streak state
- Fix XP/streak showing 0 despite completing tasks in previous weeks
- Make Gist banner appear on iPhone
- Eliminate manual "Export to Claude" step — auto-sync completed tasks to TASKS.md
- Add 6 work tasks: Book hotel Amsterdam (#1), Slides Fashion Commerce, Panagora Klaviyo, LTV Plus Lunch Vouchers, Follow up Nenad, Ping Spanish partners + Blas
- Add Japan Trip section: Book hotel Taiwan May 9th, Confirm itinerary
- Fix DTN not updating on mode switch
- Fix accidental task completion (whole row was clickable)
- Fix "Due today" badge showing twice
- Fix timer stopping when switching tabs
- Fix streak dots not lighting up after task completion
- Add Work/Personal selector to quick-add modal

### Done
- Git: fixed index.lock, resolved "local changes would be overwritten", set up launchd auto-pull at 10:30am
- GitHub repo audit: confirmed 516 files identical between desktop and GitHub
- Dashboard: 8-fix batch committed (see dashboard-changelog.md for details)
- Gist: canonical ID hardcoded, saved_at timestamp sync, Gist state corrected via API (XP=96, streak=0, lastDay=2026-03-30)
- Tasks added to both TASKS.md and dashboard.html
- `dashboard-changelog.md` created (technical log of all code changes)
- `session-log.md` created (this file)

### Key decisions
- GitHub Pages chosen over Netlify (Netlify free plan suspended due to usage limits)
- Gist ID `3410a8e3253dee00545350a2b745ca2d` is canonical — hardcoded in dashboard
- Token stored in `~/Projects/.github_token` (gitignored)
- Streak = 0 (correctly broken — last activity Mar 30, gap to Apr 5 too large)
- XP = 96 (9 tasks with correct dates; 91 was close but Mar 22 tasks recalculated)
- Auto-sync to TASKS.md on task completion: built but not confirmed working end-to-end

### Open issues
- iPhone sync has been unreliable — root cause was premature save() stamping yl_saved_at before gistPull ran. Should be fixed after 2026-04-06 push.
- Auto-TASKS.md sync not confirmed working on real completion
